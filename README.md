==========

BattleKits is a shiny new kit plugin for PocketMine. It is essential to any KitPvP server. 

### Features
* Awesome PvP experience
* Fully configurable kits including setting individual inventory slots and custom commands
* Supports multiple world (why not?)
* Comes with out of the box compatibility with EconomyS and PocketMoney
* Allows for custom economy APIs
* Create signs for players to get kits

### Kit signs
Battlekits allows creating signs for easy kit rewards. To create a kit sign just make the first line ```[BattleKits]``` and the second line the kit name. When the sign is created you will recieve a message if it was successful. In order to create signs you need ```battlekits.sign.create``` and to use signs you need ```battlekits.sign.use```.

### Credits
* This plugin was inspired by BattleKits for bukkit and I would like to thank all the devlopers there for making such a great plugin.
* For fault of a better I have used the BattleKits for Bukkit logo. This is not my property and is licensed under GPLv3 (I think).
* Finally I would like to thank @ZenCloud for requesting the plugin in the first place and helping guide the project.
